# Exploratory Data Analysis on Mental Health Problems

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** of mental health-related datasets to uncover insights, patterns, and correlations that influence mental well-being.  
The primary goal is to understand the distribution of mental health conditions, identify factors affecting them, and visualize trends for better awareness.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Clean and preprocess mental health survey/dataset.
- Perform **descriptive statistics** and identify missing values.
- Analyze demographic features (age, gender, profession, etc.).
- Explore relationships between work environment and mental health.
- Visualize key findings using plots and charts.
- Derive **actionable insights** for awareness and policy-making.

## 📂 Dataset
- **Source:** [Insert dataset source, e.g., Kaggle, survey data, or custom dataset]  
- **Size:** X rows × Y columns  
- **Features include:**
  - Age, Gender  
  - Work Environment  
  - Mental Health Conditions  
  - Family History  
  - Support at Workplace  
  - Others  

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Programming Language:** Python 🐍  
- **Libraries & Tools:**
  - `pandas` → Data cleaning & manipulation  
  - `numpy` → Numerical operations  
  - `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `plotly` → Data visualization  
  - `scipy`, `statsmodels` → Statistical analysis  
  - `jupyter notebook` → EDA workflow

## 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis
The EDA process includes:
1. **Data Cleaning**  
   - Handling missing values  
   - Removing duplicates & outliers  
   - Encoding categorical variables  

2. **Univariate Analysis**  
   - Age distribution  
   - Gender-wise mental health prevalence  
   - Workplace support availability  

3. **Bivariate & Multivariate Analysis**  
   - Correlation heatmap  
   - Cross-tab analysis of gender vs. treatment-seeking behavior  
   - Work pressure vs. mental health  

4. **Visualization**  
   - Bar charts, histograms, KDE plots  
   - Boxplots for outlier detection  
   - Heatmaps for correlation  
   - Interactive visualizations with Plotly

## 📈 Key Insights (Example – replace with your findings)
- Younger employees report higher anxiety levels.  
- Lack of workplace support strongly correlates with untreated mental health issues.  
- Female respondents were more likely to seek treatment compared to males.  
- Family history plays a significant role in predicting mental health problems.
